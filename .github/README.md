## About

> [!NOTE]  
> Azalea currently has a **1.21** branch! Check it out [HERE](https://github.com/Outspending/Azalea/pull/6). All development will be moved to here until its completed and working, then it'll be merged into the main branch!

Azalea was created just for fun and to learn more about how Minecraft works.
Although I decided to make it public and work on it more.
Azalea is a **light-weight Minecraft Protocol** that is written in **Java**.

Azalea is a very bare-bones protocol currently still in development.
It is **not recommended** to use this in a **production environment** right now.

This project will continue to be worked on and updated as time goes on.
I'm not planning on finishing it anytime soon as I want to add more features and make it more stable than it currently is right now.

## Current Features Being Worked On

| Feature            | Progress | Notes                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------|:--------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chunks             |    游리    | `Chunks are a very complex system, which needs to be done right. Currently chunks are using ~200MB of ram which is a no go!`                                             |
| Worlds             |    游릭    | `Worlds are currently being implemented into the main API, the old API wasn't made for worlds thus there's lots that needs to be chagned.`                               |
| Ticking System     |    游릭    | `There is a very simple ticking system already implemented into the API, it works for now. This includes Players, Entities, and Packet Syncing for Multiplayer Support.` |
| Multiplayer System |   游리   | `There is a multiplayer system that will be added, currently not working on it. We are needing to complete chunks and ticks before beginning work on this system.`       |
