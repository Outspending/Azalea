## About

Azalea was created just for fun and to learn more about how Minecraft works.
Although I decided to make it public and work on it more.
Azalea is a **light-weight Minecraft Protocol** that is written in **Java**.

Azalea is a very bare-bones protocol currently still in development.
It is **not recommended** to use this in a **production environment** right now.

This project will continue to be worked on and updated as time goes on.
I'm not planning on finishing it anytime soon as I want to add more features and make it more stable than it currently is right now.

## Current Features Being Worked On

| Feature            | Progress | Notes                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------|:--------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chunks             |    游리    | `Chunks are a very complex system, which needs to be done right. Currently chunks are using ~200MB of ram which is a no go!`                                             |
| Worlds             |    游릭    | `Worlds are currently being implemented into the main API, the old API wasn't made for worlds thus there's lots that needs to be chagned.`                               |
| Ticking System     |    游릭    | `There is a very simple ticking system already implemented into the API, it works for now. This includes Players, Entities, and Packet Syncing for Multiplayer Support.` |
| Multiplayer System |   游리   | `There is a multiplayer system that will be added, currently not working on it. We are needing to complete chunks and ticks before beginning work on this system.`       |
